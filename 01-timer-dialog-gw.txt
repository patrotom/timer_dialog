Names:_____________________________________________

Work in pair to write a very simple "timer" dialog in Java. The
dialog shall consist of three GUI components: a text field to display
the elapse time in the hh:mm:ss format and start and stop buttons to
start and stop the timer (see a demo).

Code it incrementally.
  P1*: GUI consisting of a text field and two buttons.
      Swing features: JLabel, JButton, and layout managers like
        BorderLayout and FlowLayout

  P2: Logic for starting and stopping the timer and showing only
      the start/stop time.
      Swing features: Event, event handler and event registration
        ActionEvent, ActionListener, addActionListener
	long System.currentTimeMillies()

  P3: Display the elapsed time continuously (e.g., at every second).
      Swing feature: single threadness
        To update the display periodically, use either
	the javax.swing.Timer class:
          Timer(int, ActionListener), start(), stop()
        or the Thread class and SwingUtilities.invokeLater(Runnable)

  *Complete code available from the course website.

    P3:   Yes / No

(2) If not, state briefly the challenges or problems that your pair
    encountered along with your plan to address them.

Dialog template:

      super((JFrame) null, "Timer");
      setSize(new Dimension(200,100));
      configureUI();
      setLocationRelativeTo(null);
      setDefaultCloseOperation(DISPOSE_ON_CLOSE);
      setVisible(true);
      setResizable(false);
    }
    private void configureUI() { /* configure UI. */ }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      new TimerDialog();
    }
  }
